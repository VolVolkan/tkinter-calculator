# tkinter-calculator
this calculator can make decimal hexadecimal and binary transactions with python language based backend but not finished just im bored and im loading this to here  
if you using windows the interface can looks diferent in your screen this is a tkinter issue 
working python based i mean 2**3 = 2^3 or 2.2//2 = 1 
binary and hexa just supporting one operator and not supporting ** or // just *,/,+,-
you can see tooltips after waiting on a button for seconds 
simple(classic) mod is complited but special mod's all buttons is not added 

last one: My wife who is more precious than anything thank u so much for the logo
